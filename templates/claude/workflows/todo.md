# TODO Workflow

> Use for tasks with 3+ steps requiring tracking

## Process

1. **Analyze**: Read codebase, identify steps, estimate complexity
2. **Create**: One actionable TODO per distinct step, prioritize by dependencies
3. **Execute**: ONE item `in_progress` at a time, update status immediately
4. **Manage**: Add/cancel items as needed, break down complex items

## Rules

- Use only for complex tasks (3+ steps)
- Single `in_progress` item maximum
- Real-time status updates
- Brief, actionable descriptions
- Complete current before starting next
- Save TODO files in project root as `{sensibleName}_TODO.md`
